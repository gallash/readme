<h1>Hi! 👋 </h1> 
I'm Phillip Gallas and I love creating and learning new things, exploring the boundaries of my current knowledge; I also love working alongside other highly motivated people -- since the "vibe"-wave interference is only constructive

I work as a full time software engineer at a respectable tech company in Brazil, which I take great pride in making part of. As a side project, I also work as the product owner of a project in development in the field of academic events. In my spare time, I like learning (natural and programming) languages, developing personal projects, networking with people, and going out on cafés!
